### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± My name is AndrÃ© and am currently learning Full-Stack Development. I love learning. I'm waiting for what the future brings us.

Below are my ranked languages:

| Rank | Languages |
|-----:|-----------|
|     1|   Python  |
|     2| JavaScript|
|     3|     C     |


âš¡ Fun fact: When I was a kid I jumped off the swing and fell horibly and fractured my elbow

Until now, my journey depicts something like this...

``` mermaid
graph LR;
  A(be born)-->B(grow);
  B-->C(acknowledge TI world);
  C-->D(commitment to grow);
  D-->E(GROWTH!!!)
```
AND I LOVE IT!!!
